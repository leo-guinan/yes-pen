# Yes Pen Protocol

**Building conscious infrastructure for AI training data.**

## Status: Pre-Genesis Phase
- [ ] Genesis Partners: 0/10 secured
- [ ] Protocol Design: v0.1 draft
- [ ] Hardware: Researching components
- [ ] First Device: Expected Week 4-6

## The Problem
AI trains on everyone but belongs to no one. We're building consent-first 
infrastructure that ensures every voice is heard, validated, and valued.

## The Solution
A physical consent device + open protocol that makes consensual AI training 
possible at scale.

## Get Involved
- Apply for Genesis Partnership (opening soon)
- Star this repo to follow progress
- Join discussions in Issues
- Contribute to protocol design

## Weekly Updates
Every Tuesday, we share what we learned, built, and decided.

## Commitment to Open Source
This protocol will remain open source forever. Genesis Partners govern it, 
but no one owns it.
